<!--HTML paragraphs are defined with <p> tags:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="eng">

<head>
    <title>HTML Paragraphs</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is Paragraph tag.</p>
    <p>This is another Paragraph tag.</p>
    <p>The &lt;p&gt; tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within
        &lt;p&gt; and &lt;p&gt; is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we don't use
        the closing tag i.e, &lt;p&gt;, but this may raise unexpected results.</p>
</body>
